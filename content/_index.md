This presentation isn't highly advanced or technical

Do feel free to ask questions at any point ü§î

---

I may respond to a question asking you to hold it

I will only do this if we will cover it in later slides üôá

Agenda ‚ö°Ô∏è

- what is DNS?
- why is _most_ vanilla DNS problematic?
- why would we care?
- what could we do?

---

## What is DNS?

Commonly referred to as the internet phonebook

---

DNS generally will utilise UDP üó£

---

Where a packet requires it, it may use TCP

---

## Why is most standard DNS problematic?

---

The most basic implementations of DNS

- {{% fragment %}}are not encrypted{{% /fragment %}}
- {{% fragment %}}don't enable validation of responses{{% /fragment %}}

---

An extremely simplified flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Device] -->|Request DNS Resolution| B[DNS Server]
    B -->|Return IP Address| A
```

---

This flow could be modified or viewed

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Device] -->|Request DNS Resolution| B[Adversary]
    B -.->|Request DNS Resolution| C[DNS Server]
    C -.->|Return IP Address | B
    B -->|Return IP Address ü•∏| A
```

Right hand side is optional

A more real-world flow of DNS

{{< mermaid >}}
flowchart LR
A[Device] -->|Request DNS Resolution| B[Local Resolver]
B -->|Query Cache| C{Cache Hit?}
C -->|Yes| D[Return IP Address]
C -->|No| E[Forward DNS Query]
E --> F[Root DNS Server]
F -->|Return TLD DNS Server| G[TLD DNS Server]
G -->|Return Authoritative DNS Server| H[Authoritative DNS Server]
H -->|Return IP Address| D
D -->|Response to User Device| A
{{< /mermaid >}}

---

## why would we care?

---

## what could we do?

---

A number of neat mechanisms may help in differing ways

---

## DNSSEC

Will ensure responses are correct, but not defend from observation

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Device] -->|Request DNS Resolution| B[Local DNS Resolver]
    B -->|Query| C[Authoritative DNS Server]
    C -->|Response + Signature| D[Verify Signature]
    D -->|Signature Valid?| E{Valid?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Return IP Address]
    E -.->|No| G[Failure Response]
    F -->|Response to User Device| A
    G -->|Response to User Device| A
```

---

## DoTLS

Will ensure the secrecy of queries, but not validate without DNSSEC

---

## DOH

Will ensure the secrecy of queries, but not validate without DNSSEC

---

You may well be utilising some of these options by default nowadays

---

Firefox and Chromium derivatives all offer a form of DoH or DoTLS

---

Android (v9+) and iPhone (v14+) offer DoTLS as settings

Topics to cover:

- Daily use of more security options:
  - Browsers
  - Phones
  - OS Configurations
- Further reading
  - DNS Resolver solutions
  - (ab)use of NAT in ipv4
